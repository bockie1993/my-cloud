      Tree surgery is changing in Ireland. People are becoming more aware of how precious our trees are, for many different reasons. Old native trees are disappearing and all must be done to protect and preserve them. Regrettably sometimes trees need to be felled and removed. Knowing the science and implementing the correct tree surgery methods means that County Tree Care should be the company to call when you are in doubt or if you need work done. Don't just take our word for it, check our Testimonial section or call us for references which we will be delighted to provide to you.

      With twenty years experience in Ground Clearance, Landscaping and Tree Surgery we know what we are talking about.

     About Monkey's Life:
    <br>
    <br>
      Monkeys live all over the world and come in various shapes, sizes and colors. As one of our closest relatives, these mammals are very intelligent and have opposable thumbs, allowing them to use tools and play games. There are more than 260 different types of monkeys. They are separated into two major categories: New World and Old World. The New World monkeys live in the Americas, while Old World monkeys live in Asia and Africa. One difference between the two categories is that Old World monkeys don't have prehensile tails; New World monkeys do.
